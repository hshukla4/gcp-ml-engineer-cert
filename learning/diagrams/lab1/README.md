# Lab 1: ML Problem Framing - Diagrams

This directory contains visualization diagrams created while studying Lab 1.

## Diagrams

1. **pipeline_final.png** - Final version of the ML pipeline showing the complete flow
2. **flow_simple.png** - Simplified linear flow diagram
3. **pipeline_clean.png** - Clean version with proper arrows
4. **flow_clean.png** - Clean linear flow

## Evolution of Diagrams

The diagrams evolved through several iterations:
- Initial versions had overlapping boxes and messy arrows
- Fixed versions improved arrow connections
- Final versions have clean layout and proper visual hierarchy

## Key Insights Visualized

- None of the default models (LR, RF, XGBoost) met the 85% recall requirement
- This demonstrates why hyperparameter tuning is necessary
- The visual flow helps understand the ML pipeline stages
