# My Learning Journey

This directory contains all my learning artifacts from the GCP ML Engineer certification prep.

## Structure

- diagrams/       # Visual representations of code and concepts
- notes/          # Insights, questions, and observations  
- experiments/    # Modified code and what-if scenarios

## How to Use

After each lab:
1. Run: python scripts/create_diagram.py --lab lab1
2. Add notes in notes/lab1_insights.md
3. Save experiments in experiments/lab1_variations.py

## My Progress

- [ ] Lab 1: ML Problem Framing
- [ ] Lab 2: Model Tuning
- [ ] Lab 3: BigQuery ML
- [ ] Lab 4: Vertex AI Pipelines
- [ ] Lab 5: Model Deployment
