# GCP ML Engineer Certification Progress

## âœ… Completed Labs

### Lab 1: ML Problem Framing (2024-01-13)
- **Objective**: Understand ML problem framing and baseline model performance
- **Key Learning**: Default models (LR: 0%, RF: 5%, XGB: 13.4% recall) don't meet business requirement (85% recall)
- **Diagrams Created**: 10 visualizations showing pipeline evolution
- **Next Steps**: Implement hyperparameter tuning to improve recall

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings So Far

1. **Visual Learning Works**: Creating diagrams after each lab helps solidify understanding
2. **Business Metrics First**: Always start with business requirements before choosing ML metrics
3. **Baseline Models Fail**: Default parameters rarely meet production requirements
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Both code and understanding improve through iteration
